# Contributing to ESPHome

For a detailed guide, please see [contributing-to-esphom](https://esphome.io/guides/contributing.html#contributing-to-esphome

Things to note when contributing:

-   Please test your changes :)
-   If a new feature is added or an existing user-facing feature is changed, you should also
    update the [docs](https://github.com/esphome/esphome-docs). See [contributing to esphome-docs](https://esphome.io/guides/contributing.html#contributing-to-esphomedocs)
    for more information.
-   Please also update the tests in the `tests/` folder. You can do so by just adding a line in one of the YAML files
    which checks if your new feature compiles correctly.
-   Sometimes I will let pull requests linger because I'm not 100% sure about them. Please feel free to ping
    me after some time.
