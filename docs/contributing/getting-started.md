This page serves as an index for getting started with ESPHome development.

- First, you'll need to [set up your development environment](development-environment.md).
- Next, you'll likely want to have a look at the [architectural overview](/architecture/overview).
- Beyond that, have a look at our contributing guides:
    - [Code](code.md) and related [important notes](code-notes.md)
    - [Documentation](docs.md)
- Finally, you can [submit your work for integration into ESPHome](submitting-your-work.md).
