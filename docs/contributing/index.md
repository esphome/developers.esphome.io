Contributions to the ESPHome suite are very welcome! All the code for the projects
is hosted on GitHub and you can find the sources here:

-   [ESPHome](https://github.com/esphome/esphome>): Project Source Code
-   [ESPHome-Docs](https://github.com/esphome/esphome-docs): Project user manual
-   [developers.esphome.io](<https://github.com/esphome/developers.esphome.io>): This developers guide.


Best practice Just clone the repository locally, do the changes for your new feature/bug fix and submit
a pull request.
